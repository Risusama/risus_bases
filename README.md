# risus_bases
  Public repository for the open-sourced oldnags_bases DayZ addon. (Although renamed in a *very original* way ;D)  
  Also released on Steam Workshop - [Risu's bases](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3083277274)

  The addon has been announced open-source for a while now, but I'm not aware of any public repositories for it with the source available in human-readable form, so I asked Oldnags for permission to upload it here.
  Pictures of this permission as proof are in the repo root, though it was pretty free-form of a conversation.
  
## What is the plan?
#### Immediate goals:
  - Remake models and textures that need to be remade. [(Issue #1)](https://github.com/Risusama/risus_bases/issues/1)

####  Near-future goals:
  - Nothing specific at this point.

####  Neverending/long-term goals:
  - Keep the mod working with each new game update.
  - Documentation.

####  Maybe?
- Extend the addon (I have some ideas and suggestions from fellow players)
