# risus_bases
  Public repository for the now open-sourced oldnags_bases DayZ addon. (Although renamed in a *very original* way ;D)  
  Also released on Steam Workshop - [Risu's bases](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3083277274)

  The addon has been announced open-source for a while now, but I'm not aware of any public repositories for it with the source available in human-readable form, so I asked Oldnags for permission to upload it here.
  Pictures of this permission as proof are in the repo root, though it was pretty free-form of a conversation.
  
## What is the plan?
  First and foremost:
  - To provide the source code to the public in an easy-to-access way.
  
  Secondary objectives (in no particular order):
  - Try to get a little bit into DayZ modding.
  - Attempt to keep the mod working with each new game update.
  - Perhaps at some point look at extending the addon (no promises yet though :P).
