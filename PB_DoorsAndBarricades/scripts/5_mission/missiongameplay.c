	//1st DayZGame is too early meaning that no RPC calls will ever get to it, 
	//but missionGameplay is perfect as its the entry point of a client when joining a session. 
	//RPCs that you init here work perfectly. 2nd reason is cuz this class gets reloaded when a player rejoins a session, 
	//meaning a config instance is grabbed fresh once again without the need of client restart.
